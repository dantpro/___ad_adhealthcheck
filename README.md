# AD Health Check Repository

Hi there!
This is my place where I'm putting all the scripts Active Directory Health Check.

To start your assessment run:

.\Get-ADAudit.ps1 -AuditPath C:\Audit 

To add new scripts add them to [Scripts](https://github.com/przybylskirobert/ADhealthCheck/tree/master/Scripts) folder.
To exclude draft scripts place them in [Scripts\Excluded](https://github.com/przybylskirobert/ADhealthCheck/tree/master/Scripts/Excluded) folder.

Template script file could be found here: 
[Template.ps1](https://github.com/przybylskirobert/ADhealthCheck/blob/master/Scripts/Excluded/Tempalte.ps1)
